        <h3>A delicious Moms` Recipe</h3>
        <p>"Before you put the potato mixture in the pan, take the scoop and make sure to drain the liquid out by holding the spoonful of potato against the side of the bowl," suggests recipe submitter and Allrecipes Allstar Lindsay. "Also we usually crush the saltines in a Baggie, it saves on mess."</p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups shredded potato</li>
            <li>¼ cup grated onion</li>

            <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>½ cup vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions:</h3>
